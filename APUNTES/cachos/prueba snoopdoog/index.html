            <p> <strong>… Is this thing on? (Word)
                … So what we get drunk
                So what we smoke weed
                We're just having fun
                We don't care who sees (shit)
                So what we go out
                That's how it's supposed to be
                Living young and wild and free,
                … Uh, uh-uhm, so what I keep 'em rolled up
                Saggin' my pants, not caring what I show
                Keep it real with my niggas
                Keep it player for these hoes
                … It look clean, don't it?
                Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
                Give me some 5-0-1 jeans on it
                Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
                And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers
                You a class clown and if I skip for the day
                I'm with your bitch smokin' grade A
                … You know what
                It's like I'm 17 again
                Peach fuzz on my face
                Lookin' on the case
                Tryna find a hella taste
                … Oh my God, I'm on the chase, Chevy
                It's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
                Dippin' away, time keeps slippin' away
                Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
                Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
                Up front, four blunts, like, "Khalifa put the weed in a J"
                … So what we get drunk
                So what we smoke weed
                We're just having fun
                We don't care who sees
                So what we go out
                That's how it's supposed to be
                Living young and wild and free
                … Uh, and I don't even care
                'Cause if me and my team in there
                There's gon' be some weed in the air
                Tell 'em, Mac
                … Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
                When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
                That's how it should be done
                Soon as you thinkin' you're down
                Find how to turn things around
                Now things are lookin' up
                … From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
                So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
                Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
                Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
                Got my own car, no job, no children
                Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
                … T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
                This is us, we gon' fuss
                And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
                And live off life
                … So what we get drunk
                So what we smoke weed
                We're just having fun

                That's how it's supposed to be
                Living young and wild and free
                … Yeah, roll one, smoke one
                When you live like this you're supposed to party
                Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
                So we just, roll one, smoke one
